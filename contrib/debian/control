 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Sscoin Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
 .
 This package provides sscoin-tx, a command-line transaction creation
 tool which can be used without a sscoin daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
